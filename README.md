The project aimed to develop an Academic Advising Assistance Program that helps advisors and students view course information, search for courses, and list courses in alphabetical order. The challenge was to efficiently store and retrieve course data, ensuring fast lookups and sorting.

To solve this, I used a Binary Search Tree (BST) as the primary data structure, which allowed efficient insertion, searching, and in-order traversal to maintain an alphabetical list of courses.
